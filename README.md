# learning-apache-beam
Simple code that can be used to help in learning Apache Beam.

### beam_learning_1.py
Most basic exmaple of how Apache Beam works. Takes JSON data stored in-memory and returns the length of each row. Great for learning the syntax basics.

### beam_learning_2.py
This script uses Apache Beam to pull a JSON file from a Google Cloud Storage bucket, manipulate the data in the file, and output it as a CSV file in the same bucket. Useful for testing integration with Google Cloud.

### beam_learning_3.py
